# Envoy

**[DOWNLOAD LATEST RELEASE (v1.02)](https://github.com/musurca/envoy/releases/download/1.02/Envoy.v1.02.zip)**

**Envoy** is a utility for [Wargame Design Studio](http://www.wargameds.com)’s series of historical wargames that
simulates command and control with order delay. Often, decisive battles turned not on
weapons and men, but on time and information: who knew what, and when? Were the correct
orders issued—and received in time to make a difference?

Using **Envoy**, you can explore these questions by composing orders for subordinates,
then passing them down the chain of command with realistic (and customizable) delay. You will
be notified on the turn when the order is delivered.

As a solo player, you can use this tool as a prompt for moving your units along
constraints defined by the orders. You can also use it to umpire Kriegspiel-style wargames for
multiple players, using the underlying WDS game to adjudicate combat.

## How do I use it?

A full [manual](https://github.com/musurca/envoy/blob/master/manual/Envoy_Manual_v10.pdf) is included.

## Compatibility

**Envoy** is currently compatible with the WDS Napoleonic, Musket & Pike, and Civil War Battles series. Support for the Panzer & Modern Campaigns series may be forthcoming.

PBEM games are supported, as long as they are unencrypted. (In the WDS game,
*Settings -> PBEM Encryption* should be unchecked.)
